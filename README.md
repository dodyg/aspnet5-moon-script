# aspnet5-moon-script

aspnet 5 brings a new architecture to .NET web stack. Many of the examples on the web jump quickly to MVC 6.0 which is a pity because the new stack has many low level wonders.

This  simple example shows how quickly you can hook the middleware architecture of aspnet 5.0 to do all sort of cool things without the beast of MVC.

The lua language is powered by the wonderful [MoonSharp project](http://www.moonsharp.org/).
