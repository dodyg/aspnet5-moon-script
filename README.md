# aspnet5-moon-script

aspnet 5 brings a new architecture to .NET web stack. Many of the examples on the web jump quickly to MVC 6.0 which is a pity because the new stack has many low level wonders.

This  simple example shows how quickly you can use the middleware architecture of aspnet 5.0 to do all sort of cool things without the big MVC 6 framework.

The Lua language is powered by the wonderful [MoonSharp project](http://www.moonsharp.org/).

The requirement to run this project is aspnet50 beta 4 on .NET 4.6 full framemwork. It will not run on .NET Core because MoonSharp is not designed for it.
